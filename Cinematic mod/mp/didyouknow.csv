Close EB makes vehicles explode on impact
The ^3/clone ^7command can be pretty useful! You can use it for still cinematics and to create fakes soldiers easily
^6<3 <3 <3
Be really careful with the case sensitivity of the commands
The ^3/clearbodies ^7command deletes all corpses at once. You should definitely bind this one!
Make sure to read the ^3help.html ^7file if you're not sure how to use something
Did you know : There are alot of mechanics that Infinity Ward scrapped in this game such as the Dolphin Dive
Did you know : MW2 was alleged to have a mail and a loot system with different rarities
Did you know : The Littlebird killstreak from MW3 was supposed to be in this game aswell
Did you know : There are references to Modern Warfare 2 in Battlefield Bad Company II and FarCry 3 
Did you know : Modern Warfare 2 originally wasn't going to be part of the Call of Duty franchise
Did you know : The big magnet on Salvage was intended to attract rockets
Did you know : The Wasteland map was in the original Call of Duty game. Its name was "Brecourt" which is also Wasteland's file name
Did you know : There's a detonator and explosives in the long hallway on Skidrow; They were meant to be usable
Did you know : Highrise's file contains scripts for usable rappel ropes and elevators
Did you know : A tank was going to be in the game as a killstreak reward
You can type ^3/clone 1 ^7if you want your clone to have a weapon
Have you found the hidden room on Highrise yet?
The ^3/mvm_score ^7command supports decimal numbers
If your game freezes after entering a command it means that the game killed the script because you typed something wrong. To fix that simply kill yourself ingame to restart the script.
You can bind commands to a key with ^3/bind BUTTON_HERE COMMAND_HERE^7
Most ^3'/mvm_bot_' ^7commands also work on yourself. Just type your name instead of the bot's
There are a bunch of semi-useless commands that starts with ^3/test_^7. Try them out if you're curious!
Did you see that?
You can join youself if you start multiple games at the same time. Type ^3/connect 127.0.0.1 ^7to join your local match
You can change the gametype if you want. Type ^3/gametype TYPENAME ^7before starting the map
Singleplayer animations can be used with the help of the Zonebuilder tool
Actor's precache is important. Please check your precache...
You can load any custom fastfile while ingame with the ^3/loadzone ^7command if you're using IW4x
The Legacy and IW4x versions of Zonebuilder are using different fastfile 'formats'. You cannot interchange fastfiles from one client to the other
If your actors are spawning in as a big red ^1Fx ^7it means that the game couldn't find the model you precached
Singleplayer and Multiplayer body models have a slightly different bone structure. You cannot use MP anims on SP bodies and vice-versa
You can spawn an actor directly with a certain animation. Just enter the animation name as a 3rd parameter of the ^3/mvm_actor_spawn ^7command
Actors are only models with a hitbox attached to it. That means you can technically turn any model into a functioning actor
You can use the ^3/scr_gameEnded 1 ^7command to get rid of all the HUD except for the score and the killfeed
IW4x got the LOD dvars unlocked to further increase the details on far distances. This mod tweaks it automatically for you
Only IW4x 0.6.0 have the IW4MVM tool integrated. The 0.6.0-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-dirty and 0.6.0 XInput do not
The ^3/mvm_throwgun [1/0] ^7command makes the bots throw their weapon MW2019-style when killed. It is still experimental however
The ^3/mvm_mw3popup [1/0] ^7command toggles a MW3-style popup message when killing a bot
You can hide or show the actor's names using ^3/ui_showActorNames [1/0]^7

All the commands that start with ^3/testClients_ ^7are related to the bots. That way you can make them move/shoot/crouch and more
If you can see that it means you're using IW4x. I like you
You can remove the big red ^1Fx^7's with the ^3r_noVoid ^7command. You will have to map_restart for it to take effect
Bots uing SMGs have a small chance to get akimbos
