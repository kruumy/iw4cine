This mod was designed for video editors who needs to create cinematic shots in the Multiplayer version of the game Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2.

It is not an external tool. This mod creates new variables (dvars) that executes a script when modified. This is not a game engine modification either. This is all done through scripting using GSC.

The purpose of the mod is to craft and create cinematic scenes or clips, using a plentiful of different features. Ideally, the only thing that would limit the user is its own creativity...

"Ideally", yes. This mod is still not finished and has been a pet project for quite some time, until a few years ago when I stopped putting time on it. After leaving it out in a somewhat usable state, I decided to work on it again in order to "finish" it, or atleast make it the best it could be.
