# **Sass' Modern Warfare 2 Cinematic Mod**
An in-game modification for IW4M to create cinematics!

## How does this works

This mod creates new variables (dvars) that executes a script when modified. This is not an game engine modification. This is all done through scripting using GSC.


## Installation

You would need a client such as [IW4x](https://iw4x.tumblr.com) in order to get this working. This mod has been built on IW4x, although it works with other MW2 clients.

> **NOTE:** Do not use this mod on the vanilla game with external tools since it can cause VAC bans.

### How to install

1. Make sure you got a `mods` folder in your game directory. If not, create it.
2. Extract the `Cinematic mod` folder inside that `mods` folder. You can rename it to whatever you like if you want to.
3. The `Cinematic mod` folder should now appear in the "Mods" in-game main menu.

> **TIP :** You can create a shortcut of your client's .exe and paste the following into the `Target` field to launch your game with the mod already loaded : `+set fs_game "mods/<TheModNameHere>"`
