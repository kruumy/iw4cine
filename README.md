This mod was designed for video editors who needs to create cinematics in the Multiplayer version of the game Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2.

It is not an external tool. This mod creates new variables (dvars) that executes a script when modified. This is not a game engine modification either. This is all done through scripting using GSC.

<br/>The purpose of the mod is to craft and create cinematic scenes or clips, using a plentiful of different features. Ideally, the only thing that would limit the user is its own creativity...

## Requirements

In order to use this mod, you'll need a copy of Modern Warfare 2 with a client installed on it.
I always recommend IW4x (personnal preference), but some people might want to use React instead.

> **Note :** THERE IS NO BETTER CLIENT FOR THIS MOD. Any MW2 client that you will find today will do the job just fine.

## Installation

Simply download the mod through [this link](https://github.com/sasserism/iw4-cine-mod/releases/latest). Scroll down and click on "Source code (zip)" and download the file.

Once the mod downloaded, open the ZIP file and drag the "Cinematic Mod" folder into your `MW2/mods` folder. If the `mods` folder doesn't exist, create it. (*You can also rename the mod if you'd like.*)

```text
C:/
└── .../
    └── MW2/
        └── mods/
            └── Cinematic Mod
```

Once this is done open your game, then click on the "Mods" tab. "Cinematic Mod" should appear in the list; click on it once and then click on "Launch" to restart your game with the mod on.
